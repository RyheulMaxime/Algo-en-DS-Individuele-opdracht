# Algo-en-DS-Individuele-opdracht
Opdracht: You must create a small digital marketplace application with Flask that connects to an existing MySQL database.
A video showing the application can be found using this link: [Video Webshop] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jWP6cYCMeHMiJQBNY8B2OHr21kmLlSAD/view?usp=sharing).

# The comands used in the CLI
first create an instance folder in the root folder of the repository, then place the local config.py file in that folder (mail me if you need the config.py file to connect to the server, for security reasons this was not included in the repository). If the configs are not provided in the environment, what happens with Render, then flask will look at the configs in that folder.

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python .\run.py

If you are using an environment:
- [Environment name]\Scripts\Activate.ps1
- deactivate
